## About

Queen’s Purity Test is an engaging web application that puts a playful twist on the classic purity test, tailored specifically for the Queen’s University community. The app presents users with a series of humorous, campus-inspired questions—ranging from wild night adventures to unexpected college experiences—and allows them to check off the experiences they’ve had. 


Once completed, your score is saved and later compared against aggregate results, which are displayed using interactive charts and statistics. The results page features detailed insights such as average and median scores, a distribution of scores presented in both bar and pie charts, and additional fun metrics like the mode score and age range of respondents. The interface is styled with a modern, matte-translucent overlay, subtle animations, and a responsive design that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, complete with theme toggling between light and dark modes.
